# **Object Detection using CNN**  

### **Overview**  
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for object classification using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which consists of 60,000 images across 10 object classes. The goal was to develop an optimized deep learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between different objects.  

### **Key Features**  
- **Deep Learning Model:** Designed and trained a **CNN architecture** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify images, achieving an **85% accuracy** on the test dataset.  
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Fine-tuned key parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate using **Scikit-learn** and **Keras/TensorFlow**, reducing training time by **30%** while improving validation accuracy to **82%**.  
- **Efficient Training:** Implemented techniques like data augmentation and batch normalization to enhance model generalization and prevent overfitting.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Used metrics such as **confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score** to assess model effectiveness.  

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Languages & Frameworks:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn  
- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas  

### **Results & Insights**  
- The final model achieved a balanced trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency.
